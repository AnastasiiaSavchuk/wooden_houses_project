    "informationType": "A new breed of prefab",
    "information1": "Once upon a time, a prefab was a basic construction - functional but architecturally uninspiring. Welcome to a new breed of prefab!",
    "information2": "The tailor-made HUF HAUS homes are bold and elegant, not to mention highly energy efficient and entirely individual. These exquisite houses incorporate the benefits of prefabrication to enhance their features. The factory construction under ideal controlled conditions ensures the highest standards of quality and assures that the on-site assembly runs smoothly and quickly.",
    "information3": "HUF HAUS has embraced the benefits of prefabricated construction and combined them with innovative design and true craftsmanship. The result is a house that boasts of expansive external glazing despite being exceptionally energy efficient. It features a very fast build time but with zero on-site waste. It is noted for its bespoke architecture where every house is individually designed for a specific client and yet it is a prefabricated house, factory built.",
    "information4": "The days when prefabricated houses meant uniformity and cheap construction are long gone. On the contrary, more and more builders are discovering the advantages of prefabricated houses.",
    "information5": "The plannability, speed and quality are particularly valued: prefabricated houses are - as the name suggests - completely prefabricated in the factory and erected within a few weeks on a prepared cellar or base slab. The individual elements form functional units. This guarantees minimum dimensional tolerances and the absence of dreaded thermal bridges. Prefabricated houses are always also energy-saving houses.",
    "information6": "Of course, all this also applies to HUF's 'prefabricated houses'. The generous glazing with fine wooden support elements constitutes the first significant difference to conventional prefabricated houses. The triple insulated thermal glazing must thereby have the same thermal performance as a thermally insulated wall. On the one hand, heat must be kept in the house; additionally, the house will not get too hot in bright sunshine.",
    "information7": "Each piece of glass is a high-tech product: vapour-plated with a reflective layer and filled with a noble gas that prevents heat transfer, the glazing achieves sensational insulation values - and give the HUF Haus its unmistakable transparent appearance and bright interior spaces."

    "informationType": "Premium: Post-and-beam construction",
    "information1": "The load-bearing parts are mainly made of timber. Relatively delicate horizontal and vertical wooden beams bear the load and redefine tried and tested principles of timber-frame construction. The durability and longevity of the timbered principle can still be admired in many old towns today. 500-year-old post-and-beam houses are not uncommon - even if the sometimes eccentrically-inclined beams do not serve as the model. Today's glued and joined timber constructions have long since overcome this disadvantage.",
    "information2": "What remains is sustainability. As a renewable raw material, wood combines ecology with economy. The vast majority of prefabricated houses today are built from wood, as no other material combines so many positive properties. Nevertheless, there are unmistakable differences to conventional prefabricated houses: Modern HUF timber frame houses are not manufactured according to either the classic timber frame construction method or the solid timber construction method. The slender timber-glass construction forms a latticework resembling a skeleton - the characteristic feature of the so-called skeleton construction method.",
    "information3": "Finally, this type of construction ensures individuality. No two HUF houses are the same, since the individual parts of the 'skeleton' can be rearranged in almost endless ways, completely as the owner wishes.",
    "information4": "Our ultimate conclusion: Discussion of whether an HUF house is a prefabricated house or not is purely academic.",
    "information5": "HUF houses combine all the advantages of prefabricated houses with an unmistakable timber-glass look and a modern timbered design.",
    "information6": "The overall package ensures that this building style is becoming more and more popular both nationally and internationally, and that is ultimately what matters."

    "information1": "UNIQUE TIMBER PROTECTION CONCEPT",
    "information2": "For many decades HUF HAUS have championed The Comprehensive Timber Protection Concept – one of a kind within the industry. Independent testing concludes that HUF HAUS exceeds legal timber protection standards 'with innovative detailed solutions and exemplary results', as assessed by timber protection expert and former academic director Borimir Radovic.",
    "information3": "SELECTION OF PREMIUM MATERIALS",
    "information4": "HUF HAUS work exclusively with Nordic Spruce enabling us to meet our exacting standards in high quality long- lasting construction. Particularly weather-resistant Spruce is dried by controlled methods and subsequently glued in narrow slats. This procedure creates a visually appealing product with tremendous weight bearing capacities and dimensional stability. The large roof overhang is also integral to the HUF HAUS design and provides additional protection against the elements.",
    "information5": "EXCELLENT INSULATION",
    "information6": "Several layers of intricate roof insulation create comfortable living temperatures throughout the Summer and Winter months. The separate raft insulation in the roof prevents corresponding outdoor temperatures from penetrating house and rooms, whilst triple glazing and the unique external wall construction also play a major role. Additional layers of insulation can be added to the inside to adapt the house for varying regional climate conditions."
