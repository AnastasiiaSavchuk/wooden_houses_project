    "story": "The story behind the house By choosing to build a one-storey bungalow, this family  with two children created an easy-access home with many advantages. Without the roof ridge determining the layout of the house, the family had great flexibility in designing their home. Since the home has no stairs to manoeuvre, it will remain accessible even as the owners advance in years. Solid oak floorboards look charmingly rustic and offer a perfect contrast to the sophisticated furniture and high gloss kitchen from StilART.",

    "purposeInformation": "The house’s modular planning structure has made it possible to create a spacious living area, where it is easy to forget that the house’s external dimensions are rather compact. With sophisticated coat rack fittings and cleverly planned utility rooms, the ground floor space is put to optimum use. In this way plenty of high-quality living space is provided, where non-conformists have room to thrive. The bedrooms that are open in the direction of the roof ridge, with their large glazed surfaces, show how compact rooms can be reconceptualised. The striking post-and-beam construction creates a dramatic contrast to the light fittings. It gives the rooms charm and atmosphere. "
